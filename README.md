# auto-traversal

## Description
Auto-movement which can be hopefully strapped to games.

## Purpose
The purpose of this software is to add auto-traversal to games that do not already have it.

## My Personal Motivation
* Develop a software package that I can use for game development later on. (The idea is that I would include this as part of a game)
* Make boring parts of the game auto done
* Eventually would like to add an AI to a part of it.

## Brainstormed components to make this work
* Interface devices with game
* graph traversal component - This will be broken as we go along
* mapping of commands to interface and graph traversal component
